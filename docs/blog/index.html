<h1><a href="/posts/note-taking-easy/">Note-Taking - Make It Easy</a></h1>
<p><i>18.05.2023</i></p>
<p><p>Note-taking is a crucial skill in many professions but it's amazingly useful in private life, too. The impact that note-taking makes in life is hard to overstate.</p>
<p>More important than the system or specific app, in my opinion, is to take notes in the first place. And the best way to achieve that, is to make sure there is as little friction in the process as possible. Because less friction means more fun and more fun means more note-taking.</p>
<p>Friction can come from many places but there are two sources that while usually neglected are crucial to consider.</p>
<h2>Speed Matters</h2>
<p>Speed matters more than any number of features. With speed I primarily mean the time it takes to open and use the app. But the navigation and UX of an app can be considered, too.</p>
<p>The speed of note-taking is neglected when you look at comparisons of different apps. The impact of loading times on our behaviour is not well understood.</p>
<p>A useful way to think about the effect of loading times is as an exponential curve.</p>
<img src="/images/load-time-usage-chart.png">
<p>The likelihood of using a digital tool goes down exponentially, as the load time increases. Unless you are forced to use it.</p>
<p>If you aren't convinced of the difference a fraction of a second can make, I encourage you to read <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/performance-matters/">this excellent article</a>. Hillel Wayne explains how electronic patient care reports have the potential to save lives, as they are more accurate than analogue ones. However, they aren't used because the interface for them is slow and unpleasant.</p>
<p>In note-taking usage is self-reinforcing. Because note-taking becomes much more useful, if you don't have to wonder &quot;did I write that down?&quot; because the obvious answer is &quot;yes&quot;. Even more reason to reduce the initial friction as much as possible. That's why I'm convinced:
<strong>Notes apps need to launch instantly.</strong></p>
<p>Now, the reality is that most don't launch instantly. Notion, Craft, OneNote, all of them take seconds to open.</p>
<p>As you can see in the highly scientific exponential curve above, when something takes multiple seconds to open, it's game over. The likelihood of usage is greatly reduced.</p>
<p>I don't think tools like Notion are without use, though. I think they are excellent ways to store and classify knowledge. They just aren't good for first-level note-taking.</p>
<h2>Write now, sort later</h2>
<p>Another way to reduce the friction of note-taking and thus vastly increase it's use is this: separate note-taking from everything else.</p>
<p>It's useful to consider what note-taking is. Note-taking is, in my view, writing something down for later. Period. Nothing else. It is not contemplating if the information is worth keeping, not applying the correct tags, not linking to another related thing, not picking the right words. Note-taking is the pure act of writing down something that might be useful later.</p>
<p>This is another reason, in my view, why Notion, OneNote and others don't work as note-taking apps. These apps require that you make a decision of where you want to keep something BEFORE you start writing.¹</p>
<p>This decision is friction. And any friction can be the deciding factor between you writing down that great thought or not and forgetting it. We shouldn't risk it. This is solved with an inbox note, where everything new goes in. No matter the topic, context, source, language, etc.</p>
<p>Personally, I use a basic but speedy plain-text editor as an inbox note. Everything I note down goes in there first, with minimal structure.</p>
<img src="/images/windows-notepad.png">
<p>While not formally organised, the inbox note can be searched with the basic ctrl + F search. This is enough to find what I'm searching, even without additional structure.</p>
<p>At a later point, when I have time, I can review that inbox note and see if there is anything worth classifying and organising in there. I can then copy something out of the inbox note and paste it in Notion, for example.</p>
<p>The important point is that organising is and should be be a separate, different activity to note-taking.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope these two points gave you something new to consider, when you think about note-taking. When you apply both of those points of advice, I would be surprised if it didn't make your note-taking easier and more fun.</p>
<p>Footnotes:</p>
<p>1: I'm aware that you could create an inbox note, as described later, in Notion or OneNote. The problem with that is that the app invites you to choose where the to put something. Seeing the notebooks, pages or tags in these apps can be distracting, even if you decide to not use them.</p>

<h1><a href="/posts/inertia-management/">Inertia Management</a></h1>
<p><i>26.02.2020</i></p>
<p><p>Have you ever improved some aspect of your life, only to wonder afterwards why you hadn’t done it earlier?</p>
<p>What was stopping you?</p>
<p>It might have been our natural tendency towards the easy and familiar, the comfort zone.</p>
<p>In physics inertia is defined as the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inertia is the resistance of any physical object to any change in its velocity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like a physical object, we tend to slide into a certain rhythm and a way of doing things. We resist change because it requires effort.</p>
<p>My goal is not to judge but to make the case that this inertia can be managed. Even better, with the right approach, it can be used to our benefit.</p>
<p>Diverse industries have independently developed methods that give their users an advantage over the competition. What these methods have in common is that they temporarily pause inertia's effects over us. This way, they put the rational part of ourselves back in control, opening the gates to meaningful improvements.</p>
<h2>Seeing beyond default</h2>
<p>To pause the effects of inertia, I believe, the first step is to put our default and easy path into context. To realize that it's just one of many options.</p>
<p>Usually in software and web development, there are many ways to solve to the same problem. Once a decision is made, however, it can take substantial effort to revise it. That is why the pull of inertia is especially strong in technical development. Developers therefore, have had to quickly find effective methods to deal with strong inertia.</p>
<p>One such a method is a code rewrite. As David Heinemeier Hansson explains, code rewrites were once seen as expensive mistakes. A code rewrite means to intentionally rebuild a software project from scratch, starting from zero. Of course, this takes considerable time and resources. Why then, does Basecamp completely rewrite their main app every couple of years?</p>
<p>One reason is that when you start fresh, you get to implement new solutions. These solutions might not even have existed when the original project was started. This benefit is particularly significant in fast-improving areas, like technology. That alone can make an expensive code rewrite worth it.</p>
<p>More importantly, starting again means that you get to draw from all the experience you have previously accumulated. The bigger the difference in experience is, the more significant this effect is. For example, if you had been following the same morning routine for the past 10 years, you likely have gained an understanding of what parts are most useful. If you were to plan a new morning routine, you could put that experience to use by designing a routine that only incorporates the parts that help you most.</p>
<p>Similarly, the zero-based budgeting method, in accounting, opens the door to new solutions and reaps the rewards of experience. The standard way of budgeting is to take the last budget and to make some adjustments. For instance, you might decide that your business should spend less money on ads next year, so you would reduce the ad budget by X%.</p>
<p>In zero-based budgeting, you start from zero and then justifying every expense individually. That way “by how much should we reduce our ad spend?” becomes “how much is the right amount to spend on ads?”. This subtle difference results in better decisions and, in this case, the company's resources being effectively distributed.</p>
<p>In both code rewrites and zero-based budgeting a restart encourages exploring all the possible options. These methods work because they encourage a bird’s-eye view of the situation. With them, it becomes apparent that the familiar and easy are just one option among many.</p>
<h2>The effort tipping point</h2>
<p>To pause inertia, however, it's not enough to explore and recognize new options. Being aware of a better option doesn’t make us automatically take it. Not by a long shot. I believe that it also takes getting to an effort tipping point.</p>
<p>By effort tipping point I mean the point at which a similar level of effort is required to both keep going or to take a new approach. Thinking: &quot;If I'm doing X, I might as well do Y&quot; is an indication that you have reached such an effort tipping point.</p>
<p>In everyday life such tipping points are rare. Once we find a path that works we tend to stick to it. Sometimes we even fail to recognize when such a path becomes detrimental or even unhealthy. To prevent that and to get to an effort tipping point, deliberate effort is required.</p>
<p>Marie Kondo’s cleaning practice strikes me as the perfect example of such an effort. The method consists, among other things, of gathering all the items of one category, for example books, on one spot on the floor. Then, and only then, deciding which items to keep and which to discard.</p>
<p>The key is to really put all the items on the floor, even if it seems unnecessary. The reason being, that the moment you do that, you reach that rare effort tipping point. Because then, if you were to keep a book, you would have to put it back on the shelf. It would take approximately as much effort as discarding it.</p>
<p>At such an effort tipping point, there is no inertia because there is no easiest path. In this rare inertia-vacuum the rational self gets to make the decision.</p>
<h2>Inertia on pause</h2>
<p>I have argued that escaping the pull of inertia takes two steps. First, it’s helpful to explore and consider all available options. One generally effective way of doing that is (re-)starting from zero.</p>
<p>The second step is to deliberately use a method designed to reach an effort tipping point, like Marie Kondo's cleaning practice. Once we reach such effort tipping point, we can make unusually clear decisions and improve what needs improving. With no inertia the best possible path forward can be taken.</p>

<h1><a href="/posts/cucumbers/">The exciting lives of cucumbers</a></h1>
<p><i>01.02.2020</i></p>
<p><p>Cucumber (Cucumis sativus) is a widely-cultivated creeping vine plant in the Cucurbitaceae gourd family that bears cucumiform fruits, which are used as vegetables. There are three main varieties of cucumber—slicing, pickling, and burpless/seedless—within which several cultivars have been created. The cucumber originates from South Asia, but now grows on most continents, as many different types of cucumber are traded on the global market. In North America, the term wild cucumber refers to plants in the genera Echinocystis and Marah, though the two are not closely related.</p>

<h1><a href="/posts/mango/">What is a mango and why?</a></h1>
<p><i>01.09.2016</i></p>
<p><p>A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica which is believed to have originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India. M. indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two distinct types of modern mango cultivars: the &quot;Indian type&quot; and the &quot;Southeast Asian type&quot;. Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits that are also called &quot;mangoes&quot;, the majority of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion.</p>
