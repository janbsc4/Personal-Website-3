# [About Me]({{ url | url }})
<img src="{{ '/images/Jan-Balanya-Scholl.jpg' | url }}">

I'm a german-spanish guy from sunny Barcelona, based in less sunny Berlin.

I've studied business administration at the Free University of Berlin. My bachelor thesis was about how executive self-interest affects firm outcomes.

I've worked at a Berliner startup as an online marketing manager, working on analytics, conversion and user journey optimisation.

After that I took web development courses and started my current job as a tracking and analytics consultant at [Smart Digital](https://www.smart-digital.de). Smart Digital specialises in user-centric personalisation and data driven marketing.
