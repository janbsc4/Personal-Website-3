# [About Me]({{ url | url }})
<img src="{{ '/images/Jan-Balanya-Scholl.jpeg' | url }}">

I'm a german-spanish web consultant based in Barcelona.

I've studied business administration at the Free University of Berlin.

I've worked at a Berliner startup as an online marketing manager, working on analytics and conversion optimisation.

After that I took web development courses and started my last job as a tracking and analytics consultant at [Credera](https://www.credera.com). There I worked as a project and team lead for web tracking projects for clients in the automotive industry.

You can find me on [LinkedIN](https://de.linkedin.com/in/jan-balanya-scholl).
