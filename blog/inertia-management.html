				<h1>Inertia management</h1>
				<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia">Wikipedia:</a></p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>Inertia is the resistance of any physical object to any change in its velocity.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>Have you ever changed or improved some aspect of your life, only to wonder why you hadn’t done that before? Join me in blaming inertia for that.</p>

				<p>By inertia, I mean the tendency to continue doing something just because it’s easy and familiar. If you’ve ever met the demonic combination of Netflix and a couch, you know what I mean by inertia.</p>

				<p>My goal here is not to judge but to make the case that inertia can be managed to benefit us.</p>

				<p>Worldwide and across industries, effective methods have proven that managing inertia can work. These methods temporarily pause its effects and its influence over us. This, in turn, enables tremendous improvements and growth because it puts the rational part of ourselves in control.</p>
			</section>

				<h2>Seeing beyond default</h2>

				<p>To pause the effects of inertia, I believe, the first step is to put the default and easy path into context. To realize that it is just one of many options.</p>

				<p>In programming there usually are many possible solutions to the same problem. However, once a decision is made, it can take a lot of effort to revise it. That is why I suspect that the effect and temptation of inertia is especially strong in software development. And so it stands to reason that programmers have had to find ways to deal with it.</p>

				<p>One way to manage this strong inertia could be code rewrites. As David Heinemeier Hansson puts it in <a href="https://businessofsoftware.org/2015/10/david-heinemeier-hansson-rewrite-basecamp-business-of-software-conference-video-dhh-bos2015/">this talk</a>, code rewrites were seen as an expensive mistake. A code rewrite means intentionally completely rebuilding a software project from scratch. Of course, this takes time and is potentially very expensive.</p>

				<p>However, when starting from scratch it makes sense to ask what the current best possible solutions are. It makes sense to explore all options, because you get to choose again. The value derived from such an exploration of options, is why, despite its cost a code rewrite can be worth it. Among other reasons, that is why Basecamp rewrites their main product every couple of years.</p>

				<p>In accounting there is the zero-based budgeting method, that also opens the door to new options. The standard way of budgeting is to take the last budget and to make some adjustments. For instance, you might decide that your business should spend less on ads next year, so you could reduce the ad budget by X%.</p>

				<p>In zero-based budgeting, you start from zero and then justifying every expense one by one. That way “by how much should we reduce our ad spend?” becomes “how much is the right amount to spend on ads?” or “what are all the ways we should spend our money?”. The result are usually better decisions. In this case, better distributed resources.</p>

				<p>In both cases a restart invites asking questions and to explore all possible options. It encourages a bird’s-eye view. And from that perspective it’s easy to see that the familiar and easy way, is just one of many.</p>

				<p>But to pause inertia it isn’t enough just to explore all available options. As we all know, being aware of a better option doesn’t make us automatically take it. I believe that it also requires getting to an effort tipping point.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>The effort tipping point</h2>

				<p>Whenever you think: “I might as well do X”, you might have reached an effort tipping point. By that I mean when a similar level of effort is required both to keep going and to take a new route. This required effort includes both mental and physical effort.</p>

				<p>In everyday life, such tipping points are rarely reached. Once we find a path that works for us we usually don’t reconsider it. This is the case even when that path no longer makes sense, because we or our circumstances have changed. To counteract that, a deliberate effort, system or method is required. The goal should be to reach an effort tipping point because it is key to implement solutions that are better fitted to our current situation.</p>

				<p>Marie Kondo’s cleaning method strikes me as the perfect example for a practical way of getting to that point. The method consists, among other things, of gathering all the items of one category, for example books, on one spot on the floor. Then, and only then, deciding which items to keep and which to discard.</p>

				<p>The trick is really putting all items on the floor, even if at first it might seem unnecessary. The reason being, in my estimation, that the moment you do that, you reach that rare effort tipping point. Because then, if you decide to keep a book, you would have to put it back on the shelf. It would take approximately as much effort as discarding it.</p>

				<p>At this tipping point, there is no inertia, because there is no easy familiar path. That way, the rational self, not the auto-pilot self, gets to make the decision.</p>

				<h2>Inertia on pause</h2>

				<p>I have argued that escaping the pull of inertia takes two steps. First, it’s helpful to explore and consider all available options. A generally effective way of doing that is (re-)starting from zero.</p>

				<p>The second step is using a method or system to get to an effort tipping point, where the available options take similar amounts of effort.</p>

				<p>From there, the best decisions can be made and implemented comparatively easily. The weight of past decisions and the pull of inertia is lifted. The best possible path forward can be taken.</p>
