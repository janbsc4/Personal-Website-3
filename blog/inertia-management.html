			<h1>Inertia Management</h1>

			<p>Have you ever changed or improved some aspect of your life, only to wonder why you hadn’t done that before? Join me in blaming inertia for that.</p>

			<p>This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia">Wikipedia's</a> definition of inertia:</p>

			<blockquote>
			<p>Inertia is the resistance of any physical object to any change in its velocity.</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>What I mean by inertia, is the tendency to continue doing something just because it’s easy and familiar. Along the lines of sitting on the couch watching Netflix after work.</p>

			<p>My goal here is not to judge but to make the case that inertia can be managed. It can be used to our benefit.</p>

			<p>Across countries and industries inertia-managing methods have been developed. These methods temporarily pause inertia's effects and its influence over us. This puts the rational part of ourselves back in control. With inertia paused, the path to improvement is unlocked.</p>

			<h2>Seeing beyond default</h2>

			<p>To pause the effects of inertia, I believe, the first step is to put the default and easy path into context. To realize that it's just one of many options.</p>

			<p>Usually in programming there are many solutions to the same problem. However, once a decision is made, it can take a lot of effort to revise it. That is why I suspect that the effect and the temptation of inertia is especially strong in software development. Therefore, it stands to reason that programmers have had to find ways to deal with it.</p>

			<p>One way to manage the inertia are code rewrites. As David Heinemeier Hansson explains in <a href="https://businessofsoftware.org/2015/10/david-heinemeier-hansson-rewrite-basecamp-business-of-software-conference-video-dhh-bos2015/">this talk</a>, code rewrites were once seen as expensive mistakes. A code rewrite involves intentionally and completely rebuilding a software project from scratch. Of course, this takes a lot time and resources. Why then, does Basecamp completely rewrite their main product every couple of years?</p>

			<p>One reason is that when you start again, you get to implement new solutions. These solutions might not even have existed when the original code was written. If a significantly better solution is found, this alone can make a code rewrite worth it.</p>

			<p>But there are other reasons. Starting again means you get to use the experience you gained when developing the previous versions. This can be a big deal, especially if the previous version was the first version.</p>

			<p>In accounting there is the zero-based budgeting method, that also opens the door to new options. The standard way of budgeting is to take the last budget and to make some adjustments. For instance, you might decide that your business should spend less on ads next year, so you could reduce the ad budget by X%.</p>

			<p>In zero-based budgeting, you start from zero and then justifying every expense one by one. That way “by how much should we reduce our ad spend?” becomes “how much is the right amount to spend on ads?”. This results in better decisions and in this case, resources are distributed better.</p>

			<p>In both cases a restart encourages to question and to explore all possible options. It encourages a bird’s-eye view and from which it’s clear to see that the familiar and easy are just one of many options.</p>

			<h2>The effort tipping point</h2>

			<p>To pause inertia it's not enough to explore and recognize new options. Being aware of a better option doesn’t make us automatically take it. Not by a long shot. I believe that it also takes getting to an effort tipping point.</p>

			<p>What I mean by effort tipping point is this: a similar level of effort is required to either keep going or to take a new route. &quot;If I'm doing X, I might as well do Y&quot; is an indication that you might have reached such an effort tipping point. </p>

			<p>In everyday life, such tipping points are rare. Once we find a path that works we tend to stick to it. We can even fail to recognize when these paths become unhelpful or even harmful. Thus, deliberate effort and method is required to prevent that and to get to an effort tipping point.</p>

			<p>Marie Kondo’s cleaning practice strikes me as the perfect example of such a method. The method consists, among other things, of gathering all the items of one category, for example books, on one spot on the floor. Then, and only then, deciding which items to keep and which to discard.</p>

			<p>The trick is to really put all the items on the floor, even if it seems unnecessary. The reason being, that the moment you do that, you reach that rare effort tipping point. Because then, if you where to keep a book, you would have to put it back on the shelf. It would take approximately as much effort as discarding it.</p>

			<p>At such an effort tipping point, there is no inertia, because there is no easiest path. In this inertia-vacuum the rational self gets to make the decision.</p>

			<h2>Inertia on pause</h2>

			<p>I have argued that escaping the pull of inertia takes two steps. First, it’s helpful to explore and consider all available options. One generally effective way of doing that is (re-)starting from zero.</p>

			<p>The second step is to deliberately use a method to get to an effort tipping point, where all the available options take similar amounts of effort.</p>

			<p>From there, the best decisions can be made and implemented comparatively easily. The weight of past decisions and the pull of inertia is lifted. The best possible path forward can be taken.</p>
