				<h1>Inertia management</h1>

				<blockquote>
				<p>Inertia is the resistance of any physical object to any change in its velocity.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>Have you ever changed or improved some aspect of your life, only to wonder why you hadn’t done that before? Join me in blaming inertia for that.</p>

				<p>By inertia, I mean the tendency to continue doing something just because it’s easy and familiar. If you’ve ever met the demonic combination of Netflix and a couch, you know what I mean by inertia.</p>

				<p>My goal here is not to judge but to make the case that inertia can be managed. It can be used to our benefit.</p>

				<p>Across countries and industries inertia-managing methods have been developed. These methods temporarily pause inertia's effects and its influence over us. This, puts the rational part of ourselves back in control. With inertia paused, the path to improvement is unlocked.</p>

				<h2>Seeing beyond default</h2>

				<p>To pause the effects of inertia, I believe, the first step is to put the default and easy path into context. To realize that it's just one of many options.</p>

				<p>In programming there usually are many possible solutions to the same problem. However, once a decision is made, it can take a lot of effort to revise it. That is why I suspect that the effect and temptation of inertia is especially strong in software development. And so it stands to reason that programmers have had to find ways to deal with it.</p>

				<p>One way to manage the inertia are code rewrites. As David Heinemeier Hansson explains in <a href="https://businessofsoftware.org/2015/10/david-heinemeier-hansson-rewrite-basecamp-business-of-software-conference-video-dhh-bos2015/">this talk</a>, code rewrites were once seen as expensive mistakes. A code rewrite involves intentionally completely rebuilding a software project from scratch. Of course, this takes a lot time and resources. Why then, does Basecamp rewrite their main product's software every couple of years?</p>

				<p>When you start again, you get to implement solutions, that might not even have existed when the original code was written. If a significantly better solution is found, this exploration alone, can make a code rewrite worth it.</p>

				<p>But there are other benefits. Starting again means you get to use the experience you gained when developing the previous version. This can be a big deal, especially if the previous version was the first version.</p>

				<p>In accounting there is the zero-based budgeting method, that also opens the door to new options. The standard way of budgeting is to take the last budget and to make some adjustments. For instance, you might decide that your business should spend less on ads next year, so you could reduce the ad budget by X%.</p>

				<p>In zero-based budgeting, you start from zero and then justifying every expense one by one. That way “by how much should we reduce our ad spend?” becomes “how much is the right amount to spend on ads?” or “what are all the ways we should spend our money?”. This results in better decisions and in this case, better distributed resources.</p>

				<p>In both cases a restart encourages to question and to explore all possible options. It encourages a bird’s-eye view. From that perspective it’s easy to see: the familiar and easy are just one of many options.</p>

				<h2>The effort tipping point</h2>

				<p>To pause inertia its not enough to explore and recognize options. Being aware of a better option doesn’t make us automatically take it. Not by a long shot. I believe that it also takes getting to an effort tipping point.</p>

				<p>What I mean by effort tipping point is: when a similar level of effort is required to keep going or to take a new route. Thinking: &quot;If X, I might as well do Y&quot; is an indication that you might have reached one. </p>

				<p>In everyday life, such tipping points are rare. Once we find a path that works for us we usually stick to it. Sometimes we don't recognize in time that these paths are no good anymore. </p>

				<p>To counteract that deliberate effort via a system or method is required. The goal should be to reach an effort tipping point because it is key to implement solutions that are better fitted to our current situation.</p>

				<p>Marie Kondo’s cleaning method strikes me as the perfect example for a practical way of getting to that point. The method consists, among other things, of gathering all the items of one category, for example books, on one spot on the floor. Then, and only then, deciding which items to keep and which to discard.</p>

				<p>The trick is to really put all the items on the floor, even if it seems unnecessary. The reason being, that the moment you do that, you reach that rare effort tipping point. Because then, if you where to keep a book, you would have to put it back on the shelf. It would take approximately as much effort as discarding it.</p>

				<p>At this tipping point, there is no inertia, because there is no easiest path. In this inertia-vacuum the rational self gets to make the decision.</p>

				<h2>Inertia on pause</h2>

				<p>I have argued that escaping the pull of inertia takes two steps. First, it’s helpful to explore and consider all available options. A generally effective way of doing that is (re-)starting from zero.</p>

				<p>The second step is using a method or system to get to an effort tipping point, where the available options take similar amounts of effort.</p>

				<p>From there, the best decisions can be made and implemented comparatively easily. The weight of past decisions and the pull of inertia is lifted. The best possible path forward can be taken.</p>
