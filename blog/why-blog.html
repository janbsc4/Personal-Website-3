			<h1>Why a blog, you ask?</h1>

			<p>Isn't blogging what the dinosaurs did back in Stonehedge?! No... not quite. But blogging has been around for a while - for good reason.</p>

			<p>Many marketers know the importance of owning the communication channel to their audience. But it's not just an advantage for businesses to be independent from Facebook or Twitter.</p>

			<p>However, this isn't <em>Blogs vs. Social Media</em>. This is just what I personally enjoy about the practice of writing a blog.</p>

			<p>I mostly blog for myself, to keep track of thoughts and ideas. Writing them down has a couple of benefits.</p>

			<p><strong>Mental clarity</strong> – Expressing ideas in writing forces you to carefully think through them. That way, flaws in logic can reveal themselves.</p>

			<p><strong>Deeper learning</strong> – Writing about a topic encourages you to make sure you really understand it. To take it apart and figure out which parts are most important. The knowledge becomes deeper and you are less likely to forget.</p>

			<p><strong>Self-expression</strong> – By blogging you learn to better express thoughts, both through practice and by receiving feedback. Knowing how to express ideas in compelling ways is a worth mastering and bound to pay off.</p>

			<p><strong>Potential helpfulness</strong> – There are around 4,6 billion internet users in 2020. Someone out there would benefit from knowing what you know.</p>

			<p>Oh, and also GIFs.</p>
