			<h1>Why a blog, you ask?</h1>
			<p>Welcome to my blog! I’m Jan, a SEO and marketer. I also dabble in web design, development and analytics. This is where I write about stuff I find interesting. I hope you find something you enjoy.</p>

			<h2>My four reasons for blogging</h2>

			<p>I mostly blog for myself, to keep track of thoughts and ideas that I find interesting. Writing them down gives me clarity. It’s something I would encourage everyone to try, for the following reasons.</p>

			<p>Mental clarity – Expressing my ideas forces me to carefully think through them. To ask myself important questions. That way, writing clarifies my thoughts.</p>

			<p>Deeper learning – Rephrasing and rethinking something that I have learned forces me to go through the material again. That way my knowledge about the subjects becomes deeper and I’m less likely to forget it.</p>

			<p>Learning self-expression – I’ve struggled to communicate my ideas in compelling ways. By blogging I hope to get feedback to improve on that.</p>

			<p>Potential helpfulness – If I get asked something three times I’d rather write a blog post about it, than to repeat the same answer. That way it might help others, too.</p>

			<p>First and foremost, though, welcome here!</p>
