"Angrynomics" by Eric Lonergan and Mark Blyth aims to give an overview of current economic problems, the anger that they cause and to provide new solutions. The book is written as a casual conversation between the two authors.

My one-sentence review is this: simplicity is "Angrynomics" greatest strength and also its biggest weakness.

Here are some of my thoughts.

## Positive
* I appreciated the computer analogy the authors introduce to explain the economic system. The authors compare recent economic history with an operating system, with its crashes, reboots and fixes. This helped me understand the authors point of view.
* The point that a lot of current policy decisions are masked inter-generational transfer. This is politics responding to the demographic shift and to older people being much more likely to vote.
* A nuanced discussion of immigration and the anger resulting from it. The authors restrain from just branding people as racist and look at possible underlying causes. 
* This sentence summarising the EUs problems:
	> Europe has a lot going for it, it's just got the wrong policy mix in terms of one currency, one central bank, one interest-rate, all imposed on this heterogeneous group of economies.

## Negative
There are also some points I have issues with.
* The overly dramatic set-up and framing. I get that they have to sell books and get the readers attention. By most metrics, though, we have never had it better. Making sentences like this just absurd:
	> ... what it really needs is a whole new operating system. (p.11)
	Weirder still, they themselves contradict this later in the book, where they agree that the current system just needs some tweaks.
* I did not appreciate Blyth's instructions that the public should be pissed *about the right things*. Obviously meaning the right things in his estimation. This is patronising, as if the public couldn't or shouldn't decide what it is angry about.
* Recurring references to *the elites*. Implying that they are a homogenous, evil and/or incompetent group. I don't think this is helpful in any way.
* There is a discussion about the role that inequality plays in the rise of anger in politics. Eric and Mark don't agree on how big its impact is. I appreciated this exchange. However, afterwards, the book carries on as if they settled this debate. As if they agreed that inequality is the single biggest problem we face (after climate change), which is not how their debate really ends.
* In the last chapter, the proposed solutions to the described problems could have used a lot more elaboration. As is, the proposed solutions sound like magical silver bullets. The reader is led to believe that these solutions only haven't been implemented because of a lack of creativity or smarts by the legislative powers. I find it hard to believe, that there aren't any more serious downsides.

## Wrap Up
Overall I think the book is okay. It's too shallow in some crucial points, which is a shame. For my taste the book should have either been longer or narrower in scope to allow for more depth.

With the justification of writing an approachable book, the authors provide almost no references to support their claims. I think this was a mistake, as it makes their claims weaker. I also doubt that adding references would have made the book less accessible.

Additionally, I would have appreciated more disagreement between the authors. In disagreement I find the dialogue format makes the most sense. The part where they disagree about inequality and wage stagnation is great.

However, it does have many ideas in it. For most readers that means there will be something interesting to think about in this book. It works well as an entry into the topic and the authors do provide further reading recommendations at the end. And given it's only 162 easy to read pages, that might be worth your time.
