pageTitle: Note-Taking - Make It Easy

Note-taking is a crucial skill in many professions but it's amazingly useful in private life, too. The impact that note-taking makes in life is hard to overstate.

More important than the system or specific app, in my opinion, is to take notes in the first place. And the best way to achieve that, is to make sure there is as little friction in the process as possible. Because less friction means more fun and more fun means more note-taking.

Friction can come from many places but there are two sources that while usually neglected are crucial to consider.

## Speed Matters
Speed matters more than any number of features. With speed I primarily mean the time it takes to open and use the app. But the navigation and UX of an app can be considered, too.

The speed of note-taking is neglected when you look at comparisons of different apps. The impact of loading times on our behaviour is not well understood.

A useful way to think about the effect of loading times is as an exponential curve.

The likelihood of using a digital tool goes down exponentially, as the load time increases. Unless you are forced to use it.

If you aren't convinced of the difference a fraction of a second can make, I encourage you to read [this excellent article](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/performance-matters/). Hillel Wayne explains how electronic patient care reports have the potential to save lives, as they are more accurate than analogue ones. However, they aren't used because the interface for them is slow and unpleasant.

In note-taking usage is self-reinforcing. Because note-taking becomes much more useful, if you don't have to wonder "did I write that down?" because the obvious answer is "yes". Even more reason to reduce the initial friction as much as possible. That's why I'm convinced: 
**Notes apps need to launch instantly.** 

Now, the reality is that most don't launch instantly. Notion, Craft, OneNote, all of them take seconds to open.

As you can see in the highly scientific exponential curve above, when something takes multiple seconds to open, it's game over. The likelihood of usage is greatly reduced.

I don't think tools like Notion are without use, though. I think they are excellent ways to store and classify knowledge. They just aren't good for first-level note-taking.

## Write now, sort later
Another way to reduce the friction of note-taking and thus vastly increase it's use is this: separate note-taking from everything else.

It's useful to consider what note-taking is. Note-taking is, in my view, writing something down for later. Period. Nothing else. It is not contemplating if the information is worth keeping, not applying the correct tags, not linking to another related thing, not picking the right words. Note-taking is the pure act of writing down something that might be useful later.
 
This is another reason, in my view, why Notion, OneNote and others don't work as note-taking apps. These apps require that you make a decision of where you want to keep something BEFORE you start writing.ยน

This decision is friction. And any friction can be the deciding factor between you writing down that great thought or not and forgetting it. We shouldn't risk it. This is solved with an inbox note, where everything new goes in. No matter the topic, context, source, language, etc.

Personally, I use a basic but speedy plain-text editor as an inbox note. Everything I note down goes in there first, with minimal structure.

While not formally organised, the inbox note can be searched with the basic ctrl + F search. This is enough to find what I'm searching, even without additional structure.

At a later point, when I have time, I can review that inbox note and see if there is anything worth classifying and organising in there. I can then copy something out of the inbox note and paste it in Notion, for example. 

The important point is that organising is and should be be a separate, different activity to note-taking.
 
## Conclusion
I hope these two points gave you something new to consider, when you think about note-taking. When you apply both of those points of advice, I would be surprised if it didn't make your note-taking easier and more fun.



Footnotes:

1: I'm aware that you could create an inbox note, as described later, in Notion or OneNote. The problem with that is that the app invites you to choose where the to put something. Seeing the notebooks, pages or tags in these apps can be distracting, even if you decide to not use them.
